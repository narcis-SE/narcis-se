Welcome to the behind the scenes look of me!

My Porftolio is a single page application that renders different page styles based on button clicks. I specifically manipulate the DOM in this example and showcase a bit of my work as a software developer! It can be found at this link: https://narcis-se.github.io/narcis-se/

I specialize in fullstack JavaScript development, with a *preference* on working on backend. In my off time I'm a gamer, reader, soccer player, and amature chef. As a developer, I aspire to make programs that unite people, and make them more aware of whatever topic of interest I am coding about.
